# simple-calculator
Interactive Python app for calculating and displaying an employee's net salary from basic pay, HRA, DA, and tax rate using an object-oriented and menu-driven interface.

This project implements a basic expense tracking tool in C, designed to help users record and manage daily spending under defined categories such as Food, Transport, and Entertainment. The program utilizes a linked list to dynamically store each expense as a structure containing its category and amount.

After collecting expense inputs for each category, the application prompts the user to enter a total budget. It then calculates the sum of all expenses, displays individual expense details, and provides feedback on whether spending remains within or exceeds the specified budget. The program also features robust input handling and safe memory management with dynamic allocation and freeing of expense records to prevent leaks.

This console-based solution demonstrates core C programming concepts including user input, linked list manipulation, and dynamic memory management. It is ideal for beginners looking to understand data structures, basic algorithms, and expense tracking logic. Possible enhancements include allowing users to define custom categories, handling more expenses, persistent storage, and advanced reporting features
